# Bugbot review rules: zopfli C-to-Rust migration

This repository ports the C library declared in `src/zopfli/zopfli.h` to Rust. `zopfli-core` holds all logic and forbids `unsafe`. `zopfli-ffi` is the thin C ABI shim and is the only crate allowed to contain `unsafe`. The original C sources stay in-tree as the behavioral spec.

Apply all six rules below on every review. Each violation is a **blocking** Bug.

## Rule 1: `unsafe` outside `zopfli-ffi`

If a changed file anywhere outside `zopfli-ffi/` adds any of the following, add a **blocking** Bug titled "unsafe outside zopfli-ffi", naming the file and line:

- an `unsafe` block, `unsafe fn`, `unsafe impl`, or `unsafe trait`
- an `unsafe extern` block
- `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` or `#![allow(unsafe_code)]`

This covers `zopfli-core/src/`, `src/bin/`, `tests/`, `benches/`, `examples/`, `build.rs`, and any other crate in the workspace.

Also add a **blocking** Bug titled "unsafe outside zopfli-ffi" if a PR removes, comments out, or weakens `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` in `zopfli-core/src/lib.rs` (for example by changing it to `deny` or `warn`).

The word `unsafe` inside comments, doc comments, or string literals doesn't count, and neither does the `forbid(unsafe_code)` attribute itself.

## Rule 2: every `PARITY_EXCEPTIONS.md` entry has a matching test

`PARITY_EXCEPTIONS.md` lists intentional C-vs-Rust behavior changes. Each table row with an ID of the form `PE-NNN` names a test in its **Test** column.

Add a **blocking** Bug titled "Parity exception without matching test", listing the affected IDs, if any of these is true:

- A `PE-NNN` row's **Test** column is empty, or names a function that isn't a `#[test]` in `zopfli-core/tests/exceptions.rs`.
- The named test is marked `#[ignore]`.
- A PR adds a `PE-NNN` row without adding its test in the same PR.
- A PR deletes or renames a test in `zopfli-core/tests/exceptions.rs` while a row still refers to the old name.

If the table contains only the placeholder `—` row, there are no exceptions: the rule passes and `zopfli-core/tests/exceptions.rs` doesn't need to exist.

## Rule 3: FFI signatures match `src/zopfli/zopfli.h` exactly

Check every function in `zopfli-ffi` exported with `#[no_mangle]` or `#[unsafe(no_mangle)]` as `pub extern "C" fn` or `pub unsafe extern "C" fn`. Compare it with the declaration of the same name in `src/zopfli/zopfli.h`.

Before comparing, expand any export macro used by this header (none for this header — plain prototypes), and resolve the header's typedefs to their underlying C types.

These must all match exactly:

- symbol name
- `extern "C"` calling convention
- parameter count and order
- each parameter type and the return type

Use these common mappings as a starting point and **extend for types this header actually uses**:

| C | Rust |
|---|------|
| `int` | `c_int` |
| `size_t` | `usize` |
| `void` return | no return type |
| `const T *` | `*const T` |
| `T *` | `*mut T` |
| `ZopfliOptions *` / `const ZopfliOptions *` | `*mut ZopfliOptions` / `*const ZopfliOptions` |
| `ZopfliFormat` | `c_int` or matching `#[repr(i32)]` enum |
| `unsigned char *` / `const unsigned char *` | `*mut u8` / `*const u8` (via `c_uchar`) |

For any mismatch, add a **blocking** Bug titled "FFI signature differs from src/zopfli/zopfli.h" that quotes the header declaration (with its line number) and the Rust signature.

Also add a **blocking** Bug with that title if either of these is true, unless `MIGRATION.md` names the function as out of scope:

- A public function in `src/zopfli/zopfli.h` has no export in `zopfli-ffi`.
- A `#[no_mangle]` export in `zopfli-ffi` isn't declared in `src/zopfli/zopfli.h`.

## Rule 4: every intentional change (`CH-NNN`) has a pinning test

`MIGRATION.md` lists intentional behavior changes that aren't SonarQube findings (undefined-behavior fixes, hook-visible allocation or free changes) in a table whose IDs have the form `CH-NNN`. Each row names a test in its **Pinning test** column, as `file::test_name` or `file::test_a`, `::test_b`.

Add a **blocking** Bug titled "Intentional change without pinning test", listing the affected IDs, if any of these is true:

- A `CH-NNN` row's **Pinning test** column is empty, or names a function that isn't a `#[test]` in the named file (or, if no file is given, anywhere under `zopfli-core/tests/` or `zopfli-ffi/tests/`).
- The named test is marked `#[ignore]`.
- A PR adds a `CH-NNN` row without adding its test in the same PR.
- A PR deletes or renames a test while a `CH-NNN` row still refers to the old name.
- A `CH-NNN` row's **Approval** column is empty, when the table has one.

Also add this Bug if a PR adds a `CH-NNN`-style change to `PARITY_EXCEPTIONS.md` (a row whose **Sonar key** is empty, `—`, or not a Sonar rule or hotspot key). That file is for SonarQube findings on original C only.

If `MIGRATION.md` has no `CH-NNN` rows, the rule passes.

## Rule 5: `.cursor/parity.json` never loosens a ready module

`.cursor/parity.json` may contain a `modules` map. Each module has `driver_args`, a boolean `ready`, and optional `fixtures`. Once a module is ready, the parity gate pins it, and it must stay exactly as it is.

Compare `.cursor/parity.json` in the PR with the base branch. For every module whose `ready` is `true` in the base, add a **blocking** Bug titled "parity.json loosens a ready module", naming the module, if the PR:

- changes its `ready` to `false`, or removes the `ready` key;
- removes the module, or removes the whole `modules` map;
- changes its `driver_args` in any way, including reordering;
- adds, removes, or changes its `fixtures`, or removes the key.

Changing a module from `false` to `true` and adding new modules is allowed. So is editing a module that isn't ready in the base.

## Rule 6: Stored Sonar findings vs original C

The port reads a stored SonarQube analysis and summarizes it in `MIGRATION.md`. It does not start a scan. Findings on **original C** may become `PE-NNN` rows only when driver-visible behavior changes with user approval. The C sources must not be patched to clear a finding.

Add a **blocking** Bug titled "Sonar findings summary missing" if a PR adds the Rust port and `MIGRATION.md` has neither a findings summary nor an explicit "no analysis" or "zero findings" line.

Do not add a bug because the stored analysis has no Rust issues, or because no Rust analysis was uploaded. A `PE-NNN` row whose **C file:line** points at a Rust file is still a bug: parity exceptions are for original C only.

Add a **blocking** Bug titled "C patched to satisfy Sonar" if a PR edits product `*.c` / `*.h` (the oracle) to clear a Sonar finding, unless `MIGRATION.md` already documents that exact edit as an approved, non-Sonar change with a `CH-NNN` row (almost never appropriate for Sonar cleanup).

This rule does **not** require CI or the PR to fail because overall / legacy C SECURITY ratings are non-A. Flag a missing summary and C-for-Sonar patches only.

## Known gaps

These rules don't check:

- Whether a SonarQube analysis was uploaded, or whether a CI quality gate is configured. Rule 6 only checks that `MIGRATION.md` records the stored-analysis result.
- `#[repr(C)]` struct field order, types, or layout against the header's structs.
- Non-default calling conventions beyond what Rule 3 can see from the header text.
- Whether a pinning or exception test actually asserts the changed behavior. Rules 2 and 4 check only that it exists and isn't ignored.
- Other loosening of `.cursor/parity.json` (narrowed top-level `fixtures`, changed `c_cmd`, `oracle_sources`, or `compare_stderr`). The parity gate's pins catch edited fixtures and oracle sources, but not every config change.
- The parity gate's state file, which lives outside the repository.
